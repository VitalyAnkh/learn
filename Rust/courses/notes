## ch 3
```
  	fn main() {
  	    let mut spaces = "   ";
  	    spaces = spaces.len();
  	}
```
	
changes to spaces mutate the original var, hence type err - cant turn string to an int
 
```
Length	Signed	Unsigned
8-bit	i8	u8
16-bit	i16	u16
32-bit	i32	u32
64-bit	i64	u64
128-bit	i128	u128
arch	isize	usize
```

has UTF8 pog

compound types - tuples and arrays


unwrapping uses let

uses `.` for tuple indexing

array type declaration: 
```
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

multiple elements same val: 
```
let a = [3; 5];
```

cant do variable indexing of a tuple

lists are fixed size

vectors are akin to py lists
