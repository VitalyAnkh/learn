You'll be learning and practicing a lot of new Rust concepts this week by
writing some programs that have more sophisticated logic that what you saw last
with last week's exercises. The first exercise is a warm-up: to implement the wc
command line utility in Rust. The second exercise is more challenging: to
implement the diff utility. In order to do so, you'll first find the longest
subsequence that is common.
