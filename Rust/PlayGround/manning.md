The two-dimensional world is flat, like a piece of paper or a computer screen.  Flat spaces like these are called planes in the language of mathematics.  An object living in a 2D plane has the two dimensions of height and width but no third dimension of depth.  Likewise, locations in 2D can be described by two pieces of information: their vertical and horizontal positions.  To describe the location of points in the plane, you need a reference point.  We call that special reference point the origin.


There are many points to choose from in this picture, but only one is selected to be the origin.  To distinguish it, we mark it with an “x” instead of with a dot.  From the origin, we can draw an arrow (like the solid one above) to show the relative location of another point.
