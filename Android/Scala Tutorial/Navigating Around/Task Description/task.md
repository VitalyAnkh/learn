## Task Description

The **Task Description** window gives you all the information you need to complete a task:

For theoretical tasks, the description provides learning and reading materials.
For quizzes, it offers multiple choice questions.
For programming assignments, it states the problem to be solved.

Use the Task Description icons for the following actions:

| Icon                               | Description                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|**Check**                           | Check the correctness of your answer (for a quiz) or your code solution (for a programming task)|   
| **Run**                            | Run your code (for a theoretical tasks)|

We recommend keeping the Task Description window visible and not hiding it completely. If it is too distracting, you can hide it by clicking the ![](images/hideToolWindow.svg) button in the top right-hand corner of the Task Description window.

If you use two monitors, it may be helpful to switch the Task Description panel to the floating mode and move it to the second monitor, or just place it near the main IDE window. To do this, click the tool window settings ![](images/gear.svg) icon :
