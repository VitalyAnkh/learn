    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as
        part of<br>
        your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.ase let me know if
        this is ok,<br>
        and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
        you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ol>

    You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
        fall somewhere
        in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the
        kind of person
        we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as
        follows, in
        order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
            audience size<br>
            exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research<br>
        to
        take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question, my<br>
        favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
            around in a
            circle
            like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
            which involved
            huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
            tiny, very
            rapid
            movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such
            as
            Twerking.s</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
            discovered a new<br>
            dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
            Alaska and<br>
            Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
            really cold.</dd>
