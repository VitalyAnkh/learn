          <p>The knot is something that people see every day. It is
          said that the ancient people had knotted the rope to
          remember, Alexander the Great cut the knot and began the
          roaring conquest of the East, and now it is even more
          common in magic shows, and it is because of the knot in
          the movie “Deadly Magic” that a human life is lost. Then
          begins the bizarre, fascinating and deeply explored story
          of human nature. But the knot actually contains an
          interesting, fascinating and practical mathematical
          theory: the theory of the knot. So what is a knot? It can
          be commonly thought of as a knot, and more mathematically
          speaking, a knot is a simple Closed curve. The history of
          knot theory can be traced back to Gauss, Listing and
          others in the 19th century. The fascinating modern
          theoretical physics of String theory is where the theory
          of knots shines. First, let’s introduce topology, for my
          thesis is about knot theory , which is a branch of
          topology, and topology is a beautiful branch of
          mathematics.</p>

          <p>Topology is a subject whose object is a topological
          space, and whose morphism is a continuous function. Its
          form is that of a continuous function. This category is
          much more flexible than the category of measure spaces.
          For example, it allows the construction of arbitrary
          quotients and intersections of spaces. Intersection of
          spaces. Thus, topology is the basis or foundation for
          many different areas of mathematics areas of mathematics,
          such as functional analysis, operator algebra,
          manifold/graph theory, algebraic geometry theory, and
          hence algebraic and differential geometry, as well as the
          study of topological groups, topological vector spaces
          Groups, topological vector spaces, local rings, etc. Most
          importantly, this gave rise to the field of homomorphism
          theory isomorphism theory, in which we also consider
          continuous deformations of continuous functions
          continuous deformations of the function itself
          (“isomorphisms”). Topology itself has many ramifications,
          such as. low-dimensional topology or topological domain
          theory.</p>

          <p>A <b>knot</b> is a smooth (or piecewise-linear)

          <p>A knot invariant is map from isotopy equivalence
          classes of knots to any kind of structure you could
          imagine. These are helpful because it is often much
          easier to check that the structures one maps to (numbers,
          groups, etc.) are different than it is to check that
          knots are different. To define a knot invariant, it
          suffices to define its value on knot diagrams and check
          that this value is preserved under the Reidemeister moves
          (possibly with the exception of the first Reidemeister
          move, in the case of an invariant of framed knots).</p>

          A link diagram is, roughly speaking, the combinatorial
          object obtained by projecting a link in ‘general
          position’ to a plane. Reidemeister’s theorem establishes
          that one does not lose any essential information by
          passing from a link to its diagram, and thus it is
          possible to study knot theory in a way which takes link
          diagrams as primary.</p>

          to how many strands are involved, e.g. a type II move
          operates on two strands of the diagram. One important
          context in which the Reidemeister moves appear is in
          defining knot invariants. By demonstrating a property of
          a knot diagram which is not changed when we apply any of
          the Reidemeister moves, an invariant is defined. Many

          <p>In the mathematical area of knot theory, the
          unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of
          times the knot must be passed through itself (crossing
          switch) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number n,
          then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be
          changed to unknot by switching n crossings. If you had a
          piece of string possibly tangled up, and could, at a
          crossing, pull one part of the string through the other,
          then, intuitively, repeating this enough times, the
          string would become unknotted. At the mathematical level,
          there is a corresponding notion of a crossing change on a
          diagram.</p>

          isotopy type of the diagram. <b>Lemma</b>. Let \(D\) be a
          diagram with \(c\) crossings, then changing at most
          \(c/2\) crossings of D produces a diagram of the unknot.
          <b>Proof</b>. After changing a crossing of \(D\), we
          could reduce at lease one crossing with a R1 move.
          <b>Definition</b>. The unknotting number, \(u(K)\), is
          the smallest number of crossing changes required to
          obtain the unknot from some diagram of the knot
          \(K\).</p>

          could impact Reidemester move R1 or R2 on the link. With

          unknotting number of Kanenobu knot K(0,0) is 2.</h3>
          <p><b>Proof</b> . When p = 0, q = 0, the Kanenobu knot is
          like:</p>
          <p width="50%" height="50%">&lt;image&gt;</p>
          <p>And we label the crossing point with numbers 1, 2, … ,
          8. First, we show that after changing the crossing point
          1 and 8, this Kanenobu knot K(0, 0) will be transformed
          into an unknot.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>After changing 1 and 8, the knot becomes:</li>
          </ol>
          <p width="50%" height="50%">&lt;image&gt;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Then we put a R2 move to the part between crossing
            point 1 and 2, and another R2 move to the part between
            crossing point 7 and 8, we get:</li>
            <li>put a R2 move to the part between crossing point 4
            and 5, we get:</li>
            <li>put a R2 move to the part between crossing point 3
            and 4, and another R2 move to the part between crossing
            point 5 and 6, we get the unknot.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Second, we show that for any one change to the
          crossing point, the Kanenobu knot won’t be transformed to
          the unknot.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If we change the crossing point 1, we get an
            alternating knot, and alternating knot is not an
            unknot:</li>
            <li>If we change the crossing point 2, we get an
            alternating knot, and alternating knot is not an
            unknot:</li>
          </ol>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>All other circumstances could be applied to the same
          procedure. Thus the knot can’t be untied by changing one
          crossing. Then we proved the unknotting number for

          <p><b>Proof</b>. Label the 12 crossing points (excluding
          the p, q, n crossing points) with number 1, 2, …, 12.
          First, change crossing points 2, 9, then we could untie
          all the crossing point between 6 and 12. We could untie
          all the crossing points between 4 and 5, 10 and 11. Thus

          <p>Then we must prove changing points less than 2 we can
          not untie this knot. If we changes 0 crossing point, this
          problem is trivial: the Kanenobu knot K(p, q, n) remains
          not an unknot. If we changes only 1 crossing point:
          &lt;image&gt;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>if we change the crossing point 1, the part between
            is alternating and the whole knot is not an
            unknot.</li>
            <li>if we change the crossing point 2, the knot will
            become: &lt;image&gt;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>And it is not an unknot because we can not untie the
          twist in the \(n\) part, for locally it is
          alternating.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If we change any crossing point other than 1, 2,
            the situation are similar to thing above.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Thus we can’t untie the knot with only 1 crossing
          point change. Then we proved the unknotting number for
          generalized Kanenobu knot is 2.</p>

          <p><b>Proof</b>. First we should show that with the
          numbers of crossing point changes, we can untie the knot.
          When \(m&gt;n\), after changes the crossing points in the
          \(m\) and \(l\) part (do this by reduing
          \([\frac{m+l}{2}]\) crossing points), we get the knot
          like:</p>
          <p>&lt;image&gt; We can untie this knot by twisting the
          \(q\) crossing numbers first, then the 2 \(n\) crossing
          points.</p>
          <p>When \(n&gt;m\), after changing the crossing points in
          \(n\) and \(l\) part(do this by reducing
          \([\frac{n+l}{2}]\) crossing numbers), we get the knot
          like:</p>
          <p width="50%" height="50%">&lt;image&gt; We can untie
          this knot by reducing the \(p\) part first, then \(l\)
          part.</p>
          <p>When \(q + n &lt; m + l\) and \(q + n &lt; n + l\), we
          would untie the \(q\) and \(n\) part with
          \(2[\frac{q+n}{2}]\) changes, and get this:</p>
          <p width="50%" height="50%">&lt;image&gt; Then we could
          untie the whole knot.</p>
          <p>Second, we must show we can not untie this knot with
          any other ways. With theorem 5.1.2, the \(m , l\) braid
          has the same plat form with the \(n, l\) part, they are
          the only two ways to untie this knot. This completes this
          proof.</p>

          <p>　After more than five months of work, I finally
          finished writing my thesis. During this time, I learned a
          lot and felt a lot. From knowing nothing, I read books of
          Professor Jiang, and GTM series. I look up every concept
          from various source: wikipedia, The KnotBook, etc. Every
          time I understood a new concept and new theorem was the
          gain of my study, and every successful proof of a theorem
          would make me happy for a few days.</p>
          <p>My thesis is not very mature. It only deal with a
          simple situation of a special kind of knot. But this
          experience of doing my dissertation has benefited me for
          life. I feel that doing a dissertation is something that
          you really have to put your heart and soul into, it is
          truly a process of learning and researching on your own,
          otherwise it will not be called a dissertation.</p>
          <p>June, it’s always sunny. In June, it’s always the end
          of the song. In June, we refuse to be sentimental. The
          flowers give up their fragrance and we welcome the
          fruits. Graduation brings farewell, and we are on our way
          to glory. As I finish my thesis, I want to express my
          deepest gratitude to my supervisor and my dear family! I
          would like to thank my supervisor, Ms. Wan. She has been
          a role model for me, a trusted mentor and friend, both as
          a person and in her studies. She cares about my study and
          research. From choosing a topic for my dissertation,
          writing the opening report, searching for information, to
          writing thesis, she gave me useful guidance so that I
          could successfully complete my dissertation. She also
          often supervised and motivated the lazy me to finish my
          characters on time. Thank you, Ms Wan!</p>
          <p>In addition, I would like to thank to the Jike App, I
          had a group of online interesting friends to keep me
          company while I was writing the thesis. I would like to
          thank the Rust programming language which is elegant and
          powerful to write my toy projects. I would like to thank
          the Veloren game, which is a free voxel game and is
          developed in the Rust programming language. It is so
          relaxing where staying at the game world. I used Emacs
          and org-mode to produce all my papers, and then used
          Microsoft Word to format them according to the
          university’s requirements. Thanks to the creator of GNU
          Emacs, Richard M. Stallman, the creator of org-mode
          Dominik and the current maintainer Bastien Guerry, and to
          everyone in the Emacs community.</p>
