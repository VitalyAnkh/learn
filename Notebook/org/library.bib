While several prototype implementations of languages incorporating algebraic effects exist, Multicore OCaml incorporates effect handlers as the primary means of expressing concurrency in the language. In this paper, we make the observation that effect handlers can elegantly express particularly difficult programs that combine system programming and concurrency without compromising performance. Our experimental results on a highly concurrent and scalable web server demonstrate that effect handlers perform on par with highly optimised monadic concurrency libraries, while retaining the simplicity of direct-style code.},

  abstract = {This account is an introduction to mathematical knot theory, the theory of knots and links of simple closed curves in three-dimensional space. Knots can be studied at many levels and from many points of view. They can be admired as artifacts of the decorative arts and crafts, or viewed as accessible intimations of a geometrical sophistication that may never be attained. The study of knots can be given some motivation in terms of applications in molecular biology or by reference to paral\- lels in equilibrium statistical mechanics or quantum field theory. Here, however, knot theory is considered as part of geometric topology. Motivation for such a topological study of knots is meant to come from a curiosity to know how the ge\- ometry of three-dimensional space can be explored by knotting phenomena using precise mathematics. The aim will be to find invariants that distinguish knots, to investigate geometric properties of knots and to see something of the way they interact with more adventurous three-dimensional topology. The book is based on an expanded version of notes for a course for recent graduates in mathematics given at the University of Cambridge; it is intended for others with a similar level of mathematical understanding. In particular, a knowledge of the very basic ideas of the fundamental group and of a simple homology theory is assumed; it is, after all, more important to know about those topics than about the intricacies of knot theory.},

Next, we provide a comparison result relating derived complex analytic spaces to geometric stacks. Using these results and building on the previous work arXiv:1412.5166, we prove a derived version of the GAGA theorems. As an application, we prove that the infinitesimal deformation theory of a derived complex analytic moduli problem is governed by a differential graded Lie algebra.},

  abstract = {Rust claims to advance industrial programming by bridging the gap between low-level systems programming and high-level application programming. At the heart of the argument that this enables programmers to build more reliable and efficient software is the borrow checker - a novel approach to ownership that aims to balance type system expressivity with usability. And yet, to date there is no core type system that captures Rust's notion of ownership and borrowing, and hence no foundation for research on Rust to build upon. In this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. We present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as an approximation of the provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a substructural typing judgment. We provide the first syntactic proof of type safety for borrow checking using progress and preservation. Oxide is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.},
