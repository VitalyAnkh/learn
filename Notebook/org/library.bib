  abstract = {In this paper, we expand the foundations of derived complex analytic geometry introduced in [DAG-IX] by J. Lurie. We start by studying the analytification functor and its properties. In particular, we prove that for a derived complex scheme locally almost of finite presentation \$X\$, the canonical map \$X\^\{\textbackslash mathrm\{an\}\} \textbackslash to X\$ is flat in the derived sense. Next, we provide a comparison result relating derived complex analytic spaces to geometric stacks. Using these results and building on the previous work arXiv:1412.5166, we prove a derived version of the GAGA theorems. As an application, we prove that the infinitesimal deformation theory of a derived complex analytic moduli problem is governed by a differential graded Lie algebra.},
