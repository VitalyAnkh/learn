First, let's introduce topology, for my thesis is about knot theory , which is a  branch of topology
, and topology is a beautiful branch of mathematics.
** Topology
Topology is the study of the category whose objects are topological spaces, and
whose morphisms are continuous functions. This category is much more flexible than
that of metric spaces, for example it admits the construction of arbitrary quotients and
intersections of spaces. Accordingly, topology underlies or informs many and diverse
areas of mathematics, such as functional analysis, operator algebra, manifold/scheme
theory, hence algebraic geometry and differential geometry, and the study of topological
groups, topological vector spaces, local rings, etc. Not the least, it gives rise to the field of
homotopy theory, where one considers also continuous deformations of continuous
functions themselves (“homotopies”). Topology itself has many branches, such as
low-dimensional topology or topological domain theory.

In topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which
appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that
the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone, the simplest knot being a ring (or "unknot").

In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean
space, \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\) (in topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\)  upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

Knots can be described in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may be more than one description that represents the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram. Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.

A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown complexity. In practice, knots are often distinguished by using a knot invariant, a "quantity" which is the same when computed from different descriptions of a knot. Important invariants include knot polynomials, knot groups, and hyperbolic invariants.

The original motivation for the founders of knot theory was to create a table of knots and links, which are knots of several components entangled with each other. More than six billion knots and links have been tabulated since the beginnings of knot theory in the 19th century.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other three-dimensional spaces and objects other than circles can be used; see knot (mathematics). Higher-dimensional knots are n-dimensional spheres in m-dimensional Euclidean space.
** The Meaning of Researches on Knot Theory
* Chapter 2. Propaedeutics
** Knot Diagram and Reidemeister Move
A Knot or link could be in many phases on \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\)
In the mathematical area of knot theory, a Reidemeister move is any of three local moves on a link diagram. Kurt Reidemeister (1927) and, independently, James Waddell Alexander and Garland Baird Briggs (1926), demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot, up to planar isotopy, can be related by a sequence of the three Reidemeister moves.

Each move operates on a small region of the diagram and is one of three types:
1. Twist and untwist in either direction.
2. Move one loop completely over another.
3. Move a string completely over or under a crossing.
No other part of the diagram is involved in the picture of a move, and a planar isotopy may distort the picture. The numbering for the types of moves corresponds to how many strands are involved, e.g. a type II move operates on two strands of the diagram.

One important context in which the Reidemeister moves appear is in defining knot invariants. By demonstrating a property of a knot diagram which is not changed when we apply any of the Reidemeister moves, an invariant is defined. Many important invariants can be defined in this way, including the Jones polynomial.
