#+title: Rust中的自动解引用
Rust automatically dereferences types when:
1. they're being passed as function arguments
2. they're returned from a function
3. thery're used as part of a method call.

This is the reason why we can pass ~&String~ and ~&Vec<T>~ to functions expecting ~&str~ and ~&[T]~ because ~String~ impls ~Deref<Target = str>~ and ~Vec<T>~ impls ~Deref<Target = [T]>~.
