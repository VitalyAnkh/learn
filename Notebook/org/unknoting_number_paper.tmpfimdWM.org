* Chapter 1. Introduction
The knot is something that people see every day. It is said that the ancient people had knotted the rope to remember, Alexander the Great cut the knot and began the roaring
conquest of the East, and now it is even more common in magic shows, and it is because of the knot in the movie "Deadly Magic" that a human life is lost.
Then begins the bizarre, fascinating and deeply explored story of human nature.
But the knot actually contains an interesting, fascinating and practical mathematical theory: the theory of the knot.
So what is a knot? It can be commonly thought of as a knot, and more mathematically speaking, a knot is a simple
Closed curve. The history of knot theory can be traced back to Gauss, Listing and others in the 19th century. The fascinating modern theoretical physics of
String theory is where the theory of knots shines.
First, let's introduce topology, for my thesis is about knot theory , which is a  branch of topology
, and topology is a beautiful branch of mathematics.
** Topology
Topology is a subject whose object is a topological space, and whose morphism is a continuous function.
Its form is that of a continuous function. This category is much more flexible than the category of measure spaces.
For example, it allows the construction of arbitrary quotients and intersections of spaces.
Intersection of spaces. Thus, topology is the basis or foundation for many different areas of mathematics
areas of mathematics, such as functional analysis, operator algebra, manifold/graph theory, algebraic geometry
theory, and hence algebraic and differential geometry, as well as the study of topological groups, topological vector spaces
Groups, topological vector spaces, local rings, etc. Most importantly, this gave rise to the field of homomorphism theory
isomorphism theory, in which we also consider continuous deformations of continuous functions
continuous deformations of the function itself ("isomorphisms"). Topology itself has many ramifications, such as.
low-dimensional topology or topological domain theory.
** Knot Theory :ATTACH:
Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. Inspired by knots that
found in everyday life, such as shoelaces and ropes, the mathematical knot is distinguished by the fact that the
the ends are connected in such a way that it cannot be untied, the simplest knot being a ring ("unkot").

In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean
space, \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\) (in topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\)  upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

Knots can be described in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may be more than one description that represents the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram. Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.

A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown complexity. In practice, knots are often distinguished by using a knot invariant, a "quantity" which is the same when computed from different descriptions of a knot. Important invariants include knot polynomials, knot groups, and hyperbolic invariants.

The original motivation for the founders of knot theory was to create a table of knots and links, which are knots of several components entangled with each other. More than six billion knots and links have been tabulated since the beginnings of knot theory in the 19th century.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other three-dimensional spaces and objects other than circles can be used; see knot (mathematics). Higher-dimensional knots are n-dimensional spheres in m-dimensional Euclidean space.
** The Meaning of Researches on Knot Theory
* Chapter 2. Propaedeutics
** Knot Diagram
A Knot or link could be in many phases on \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\)
A useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small change in the direction of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called crossings, where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely (Rolfsen 1976). At each crossing, to be able to recreate the original knot, the over-strand must be distinguished from the under-strand. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. The resulting diagram is an immersed plane curve with the additional data of which strand is over and which is under at each crossing. (These diagrams are called knot diagrams when they represent a knot and link diagrams when they represent a link.) Analogously, knotted surfaces in 4-space can be related to immersed surfaces in 3-space.

A reduced diagram is a knot diagram in which there are no reducible crossings (also nugatory or removable crossings), or in which all of the reducible crossings have been removed.
** Reidemeister Move :ATTACH:
In the mathematical area of knot theory, a Reidemeister move is any of three local moves on a link diagram. Kurt Reidemeister (1927) and, independently, James Waddell Alexander and Garland Baird Briggs (1926), demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot, up to planar isotopy, can be related by a sequence of the three Reidemeister moves.
Each move operates on a small region of the diagram and is one of three types:
1. Twist and untwist in either direction.
2. Move one loop completely over another.
3. Move a string completely over or under a crossing.

No other part of the diagram is involved in the picture of a move, and a planar isotopy may distort the picture. The numbering for the types of moves corresponds to how many strands are involved, e.g. a type II move operates on two strands of the diagram.
The three types of moves are called R1, R2, R3 move, respectively.
One important context in which the Reidemeister moves appear is in defining knot invariants. By demonstrating a property of a knot diagram which is not changed when we apply any of the Reidemeister moves, an invariant is defined. Many important invariants can be defined in this way, including the Jones polynomial.
** Knot Invariants
*** TODO The Jones Polynomial
*** The Unknotting number
In the mathematical area of knot theory, the unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself (crossing switch) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number n, then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be changed to unknot by switching n crossings. The unknotting number of a knot is always less than half of its crossing number.
** Kanenobu Knot and Generalized Kanenobu Knot :ATTACH:
The  Kanenobu Knots, which are infinitely many knots with the same knot ploynomial invariant,[@kanenobuInfinitelyManyKnots1986] , are knots like following:

[[file:/home/vitalyr/projects/learn/Notebook/org/.attach/4f/7bf60b-78ae-4365-b59d-29b51ce88612/_20210520_031220screenshot.png]]

The Kanenobu knot with parameter p, q is represented  by K(p,q). When p>0, the upper braid  has the right curve above. When p<0, the upper braid has the left curve above. When q>0, then lower braid has the left curve above. The q<0, the lower braid has the left curve above.

The Kanenobu knot could be generalized by add more parameters: 
* Chapter 3. Unknotting Number for Kanenobu Knot
** Theorem 3.1: the unknotting number of Kanenobu knot K(1,1) is 2. :ATTACH:
*Proof* . When p = 0, q = 0, the Kanenobu knot is like:

And we label the crossing point with numbers 1, 2, ... , 8.
First, we show that after changing the crossing point 1 and 8, this Kanenobu knot K(0, 0) will be transformed into an unknot.
1. After changing 1 and 8, the knot becomes:

1. Then we put a R2 move to crossing point 1 and 2, and another R2 move to crossing point 7 and 8, we get:
